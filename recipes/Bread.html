        <li>1 packet (2 and 1/4 tsp) of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp of salt</li>
        <li>1 cup of warm water (110째F/45째C)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp of unsalted butter (softened)</li>
        <li>1 egg (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of oil for greasing the bowl</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps for Baking:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Activate the Yeast:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast together. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This means the yeast is activated.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, salt, milk, butter, and the frothy yeast mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix until the ingredients are well combined and a sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and continue mixing. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 8-10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>First Proof:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Shape the Dough:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Punch down the dough to release air bubbles. Turn it onto a floured surface and shape it into a loaf.</li>
            <li>Place the shaped dough into a greased loaf pan.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Second Proof:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the loaf pan with a kitchen towel and let it rise again for about 30-45 minutes, or until the dough reaches the edge of the pan.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Bake the Bread:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350째F (175째C). Bake the bread for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 5-10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Slice and enjoy your fluffy, soft homemade bread warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your fluffy soft homemade bread fresh out of the oven with butter or your favorite spread!</p>
