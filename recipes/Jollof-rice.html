            <ul>
            <li>Wash and rice the rice under cold water multiple times, until the water runs clear. This will remove excess starch.</li>

            <li>Increase the heat to medium or high and pour in the blended tomato mixture and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally,
                 until the sauce is reduced and the oil begins to separate from the mixture. (Add enough oil so the sauce can fry properly, you can reduce the oil after.).</li>
        </ul>

    <p><li><strong>Season and allow sauce to cook:</strong></li></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add the paprika, curry powder, thyme, white pepper (if using), salt, and maggi to the sauce. Stir well to combine.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Pour in the Broth and mix gently.</li>
            <li>Make sure the heat is set to low.</li>
        </ul>

    <p><li><strong>Cook the Jollof rice:</strong></li></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover and seal the pot tighly with alluminium foil and let it cook in low heat for about 10 minutes intervals, 
                add little water at intervals depending on how soft you want the grains to be, add some sliced onion at third interval.</li>
            <li>Rice should be fully cooked after third interval. (At each interval, avoid opening the lid for too long so the steam will not escape too quickly).</li>
            <li>Once the rice is tender and fully cooked, remove from heat. Add the butter (if using), and fluff the rice with a fork.</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p><li><strong>Serve:</strong></li></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serve the Jollof Rice hot with your choice of side dishes like fried plantains, fried chicken, or salad.</li>
