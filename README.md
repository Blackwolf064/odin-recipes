This is a basic recipe website

This is part of the Odin Project and my first website.

#Project Structure
The project consists of an index.html file containing different links to recipes from other websites.

HTML used.

#My learning goals
Practice what i have learnt so far which includes HTML basics, how to use Git on terminal and how to set up a new repository on github.

To view this project, simply open the "index.html" file in a web browser.

#fixed a problem
The image on the jollof-rice.html page was not showing, I discovered it was because i made an error and did not create the "images" file path inside the recipes folder, rather it was outside the recipes folder, so it was unable to read the image correctly. 
I moved the "images" file into the recipes folder and now it works correctly.
